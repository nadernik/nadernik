## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Nader, a research scientist at the McGovern Institute at MIT. My work bridges behavior, neurotechnology, and computation to understand how brain circuits generate complex learned behaviors. This repo features projects in neural data analysis, behavioral modeling, and brain-inspired AI.

-Iâ€™m currently working on brain-inspired models of sequential behavior and thalamocortical dynamics at MIT
-Iâ€™m learning more about AI interpretability and large-scale modeling
-Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on neuroscience-inspired ML and behavior analysis
