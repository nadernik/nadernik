## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Nader, a research scientist at the McGovern Institute at MIT. My work bridges behavior, neurotechnology, and computation to understand how brain circuits generate complex learned behaviors. This repo features projects in neural data analysis, behavioral modeling, and brain-inspired AI.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on brain-inspired models of sequential behavior and thalamocortical dynamics at MIT
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning more about AI interpretability and large-scale modeling
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on neuroscience-inspired ML and behavior analysis
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about multisensory decision-making, cortical dynamics, or building experimental rigs
âš¡ Fun fact: I once showed that rodents can see under red lightâ€”changing how labs house and test them
